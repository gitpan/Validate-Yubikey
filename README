Validate::Yubikey - Validate Yubikey OTPs

The Yubikey is a hardware OTP token produced by Yubico (http://www.yubico.com).

This module provides validation of Yubikey OTPs.  It relies on you to specify
callback functions that handle retrieving token information from somewhere and
updating the persistent information associated with each token.
